Order matters in Test Driven Development. Before writing the program itself, you’ll start by writing a test that’s designed to fail. You’ll then create a program that should pass the test and run the test. If the program fails, you would refactor it until your test gives the green light. But a passing test doesn’t necessarily mean the end of refactoring. In fact, “red, green, refactor” is a common phrase among test-driven developers: Red signals a failing test, green indicates a passing test and refactor refers to shaping up the code of a passing test until it’s clean.
